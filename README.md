# React Native Elements Avatar Bug

## Run This App
Type `npm run ios` or `react-native run-android` to start the app.

## The Bug
On iOS the avatar correctly is transparent. On Android however it has a grey background, even though when inspected with the Inspector it has `background: transparent`.
